### 2.0 Integrating R-Studio and Github

Github as it is naturally operates similarly to Google Drive as we have discovered, but with that additional step of requiring a commit. However, where it truly gains its power is the level of integration it has with R. Github supports all operations that can be conducted on Rstudio. This includes generating reports, creating websites, and creating applications. Before we explore any of those topics further, we first need to understand how the basic operations are conducted. 

### 2.1 Creating a Project

R Studio allows for the creation of projects, which is an enclosed environment that files that are used and produced are kept in the same folder. For those of you that might be R-Users but do not use R Studio, this saves the effort that goes into specifying the file path or changing the working directory everytime you open or save a file. Step 1 let us open R and see what our interface looks like.

You will likely have three panels open that on default are the R Console (Left), the connections panels (top right), and files/visualizer (bottom right). The R console works exactly like your standard R and is where you can type code or copy it from a script. Normally you would load a script to fit in the top left panel that will have all your analyses. The top right contains your environment with all your operations or datasets. However, it also has this **Git** tab that is how your Rstudio communications with your online repository. The bottom right is the repository file path. 

Let's open your Github repository on R Studio. First you need to go back to your Github repository online. Then click to get the website path using the clone repository button.

Moving back to R Studio you will click through the following opens:
- File -> New Project
- Version Control
- Git
- Paste the website path into Repository URL

Once pasted you will have now copied all files from your online repository onto your computer. This will include the hangman file if you were Person A. This cloning would also work with other people's repository and is not limited to just yours. 

You will now see a newly generated tab in the communications panel in the top right of your console. There are a few items here that important and useful. First is the commit button that when you click on it will bring up another panel. This panel identifies files that have been modified and gives you the opportunity to stage them. The staging step is a way to tell R Studio that you are selecting these files to be commited. You should currently have it empty since you just downloaded the repository, everything should be up-to date. 

### 2.2 Pushing files to Github

Let's change that. Open your hangman file if you're **Person A** If you are **Person B** or a third wheeler, create your open hangman file by going to File --> New File --> R Script and save it. Once the file is open, modify it or write something in it and then save. You should now see that file populate in the panel under Git. We are now going to commit it.
